# Ghost Bros Walkie-Talkie
## An open source "Fake" walkie-talkie for Fake Ghost Tours made by my friends in Vancouver.

When I say "Fake" walkie-talkie, what I mean is that this walkie-talkie does not do two way commincation. It actually doesn't even do one way communication(if you don't count the gps). 
This walkie-talkie was designed for my friends at Fake Ghost Tours [FakeGhostTours.com](http://fakeghosttours.com) - real friends not fake friends.

The purpose of the walkie-talkie is to be a GPS guided audio tour of fake ghost stories in Vancouver, British Columbia. 
Watch the video to see how it works, and why it was made.
